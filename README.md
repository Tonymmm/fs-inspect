<h1>FS-Inspect 1.7 (Build 20140515)</h1>

FS-Inspect is an easy to use tool designed to give you an overview about your files and directories (Disk Usage).

On start up, it reads recursively the inspected directory and presents the content in two useful views:

 * The folder view, shows the directory tree, sub-folders are sorted by size.
 * The type view, shows all file types found, sorted by the total size. 

In the post scan, the utility start searching for duplicates. All duplicates are listed in the file view, colored depending on their MD5-checksum.

It is possible to configure the duplicate search in the settings. To optimize the duplicate search, hashes are stored in a database. If a directory is inspected many a time, there is no need to compute the performance-expensive check-sum again.
